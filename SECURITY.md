# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| v1.x.x  | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability affecting any of our supported projects, please
email [edward@cheng.sydney](mailto:edward@cheng.sydney), rather than opening a public issue on GitHub. After receiving
the initial report, we will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement. We may
ask you for additional information. You are also welcome to propose a patch or solution.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We aim to patch confirmed vulnerabilities within 30 days or less, disclosing the details of those vulnerabilities when a
patch is published. We ask that you refrain from sharing your report with others while we work on our patch.

We may want to coordinate an advisory with you to be published simultaneously with the patch, but you are also welcome
to self-disclose after 90 days if you prefer. We will never publish information about you or our communications with you
without your permission.
